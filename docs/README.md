Documentation for KGCOEReport LaTeX Template
============================================

# General Usage
Stick the `KGCOEReport.cls` file in the same folder as the `.tex` document (or in a global location)
and use it as the document class with the department code as an option

```
\documentclass[CMPE]{KGCOEReport}
```
# Cover Page Variables
The following is a list of variables used by the template.
Examples are provides in the enclosing brackets.

## Generic Variables
### Required
* `\classCode`: The 4 character code and 3 digit number `[CMPE 160]`
* `\exerciseNumber`: The exercise number `[1]` or `[One]`
* `\exerciseDescription`: Short description of the exercise. Generally taken from the exercise write-up `[Characterizing a OPB745 Sensor]`
* `\name`: Your name `[Jeff Mahoney]`
* `\dateDone`: The date the lab was performed in ISO 8601 format. If done over several lab periods then the first date `[2016-09-19]`
* `\dateSubmitted`: The date the report is due in ISO 8601 format `[2016-09-26]`
* `\LabSectionNum`: The lab section number `[01]`

## CMPE Specific Variables
### Required
* `\LabInstructor`: The name of the instructor for the lab section `[Professor Professor]`
* `\LectureSectionNum`: The lecture section number `[03]`
* `\LectureInstructor`: The name of the instructor for the lecture section `[Professor X]`
* `\TAs`: A list of TA's separated by double backslashes `[TA One \\ TA Two \\ TA Three]`


## EEEE Specific Variables
### Required
* `\className`: The full name of the class `[Electronics 1]`
* `\TAs`: A list of TA's separated by ands `[TA One and TA Two and TA Three]`

### Optional
* `\partnerName`: The name of your partner `[Gary Lake]`


# Pandoc template
[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) is a markup converter.
In particular, it can convert [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to a LaTeX formatted PDF.
In this way, much of the LaTeX boilerplate is done away with.

## Usage
To use, install [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) and copy the template (along with the KGCOEReport class file)
to your lab folder.
Once the report is written, the PDF can be compiled by executing

```
pandoc <lab file>.md --template=pandoc_full_template.tex -s -o <output file>.pdf
```

The report must end in `.md` to signify that it is a Markdown file.

## Writing a report in Markdown
Markdown is made to be readable, both in text and formatted, and is very simple to write.
You can refer to the `GENERIC_sample_pandoc.md` to get an idea

### Header
To allow Pandoc to format your document correctly, a YAML header must first be added
containing the variables.
(This header is non-standard Markdown and is purely used for Pandoc)

All variables are the same as above, with the only difference is that the
`department` key is added to know what to format the document as.
A sample is as follows

```
---
department: CMPE
classCode: CMPE 101
className: Intro to Computer Engineering
exerciseNumber: 1
exerciseDescription: Measuring resistance
name: Jeff Mahoney
partnerName: Gary Lake
dateDone: 2016-09-19
dateSubmitted: 2016-09-2016-09-26
LabSectionNum: L03
LabInstructor: Professor Professor
TAs: TA One and TA Two and TA Three
LectureSectionNum: 02
LectureInstructor: Professor X

documentclass: KGCOEReport
numbersections: false
---
```

The `documentclass` section tells Pandoc to use our class file.
The `numbersections` key is used to tell Pandoc if we want numbered sections or not.
For KGCOE reports, sections are generally not numbered.

### Body
Everything after the header is what will be generated for the document.
Regular text will show up as text in paragraphs.
Paragraphs are sectioned of as a blank line between two sections of text.
As in LaTeX, a newline at the end of a line is interpreted as a space.

The following is a short list of commonly used formating syntax.
There are far too many to cover, so refer to the [Pandoc User Guide](http://pandoc.org/README.html#pandocs-markdown)
for more detail.

#### Sections
Sections are defined by `#`, one space, and then the section name

```
# Abstract
```

#### Math Equation
Math equations use the `$` character.
Equations are enclosed in these characters using the
[LaTeX math formatting syntax](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Mathematical_expressions)

A single `$` inlines an equation.
There must not be any spaces between the opening `$` and the first character,
and there must not be a space between the last character and the closing `$`

```
... $F = ma$ ...
```

A double `$$` centers the equation and puts it on a new line.
The space requirement is not in effect for this.

```
...
$$ F = -kx $$
...
```

#### Images
Images use the link syntax prepended with a `!`.
The image caption is enclosed within `[]`, while the image location is enclosed within `()`.

There must be a new line above and below the image line or Pandoc will attempt to inline the image (and fail.)

```
